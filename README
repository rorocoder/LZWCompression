Code now works as it should, it creates 2 files
1st File is "output.dat" and has our compression as a binary string
2nd File is "byteOutput.txt" and has our compression as bytes as characters
I am encoding with 12 bits
I am not completely sure whether the outputted bytes are correct but I have no reason to think it isn't
